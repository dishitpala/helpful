== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I show votes after voting? =

You can. Simply use {pro} and {contra} in your texts to show the vote number.

= Can I use my own CSS files? =

You can. Choose `theme` as theme in the helpful options. Then create an `helpful` folder and an `theme.css` file in it. Fill the `theme.css` file with your CSS and you're done.

= Are there any shortcodes I can use? =

You can. Just use the shortcode `[helpful]` to output Helpful.

= Do I need to consider anything when reporting problems? =

Important are the PHP version and the plugin version. You can check the settings of the plugin. In the sidebar you will find what you are looking for.

= Is AMP supported by the plugin? =

I'm afraid not. I have not dealt with it and only know that there are problems with Javascript. If you have a solution, you are welcome to share it in the forum.

= Why is the code editor not displayed in the options? =

For the code editor you need at least version 4.9 of WordPress. Without this version, a text field will be displayed instead of the editor. The editor is used for custom CSS.

= I'm a programmer, can I help? =

Sure. Helpful is now also available on [Github](https://github.com/pixelbart/helpful). I will always update the code first and fix issues with Codacy. You are always welcome to help. Forke Helpful and start bullying!
